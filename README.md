Pdf file includes the implementation (Verilog). 

The project is a kind of two-player Power Pong game. There are two rackets which are controlled with BASYS 2 buttons. There are 4 of them so left two is for player 1 and others are for player 2. By pressing them rackets move up or down on the monitor according to pressed buttons. (Actually my partner and I thought a keyboard to control rackets but we changed our minds since we could not achieve to get two simultaneously pressed key scan code from PS2 keyboard.) Display of the game will be demonstrated on monitor and scores will be showed on 7-segment LED display unit.
